# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Doug!

I'm a web developer, analytics-engineering-tinkerer, general technologist, and strategist. I'm curious and good at the Internet, which can be a dangerous combination. Sometimes people share their problems with me, and I help them find a solution.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently evaluating business intelligence (BI) tools like [Metabase](https://metabase.com) and [Mode](https://mode.com). I'm fully-versed in [Sisense](https://sisense.com).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but you're still welcome to reach out.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m not looking for help with anything at the moment.
