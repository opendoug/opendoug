# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Doug!

I'm a web developer, analytics-engineering-tinkerer, general technologist, and strategist. I'm curious and good at the Internet, which can be a dangerous combination. Sometimes people share their problems with me, and I help them find a solution.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as the Director of Strategy & Technology at [Elite Development Group](https://elite.team).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently migrating some data pipelines from [AppFolio's](https://www.appfolio.com/stack/partners/api) v1 API to the new v2.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but you're still welcome to reach out.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m not looking for help with anything at the moment.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about APIs! Over the last two years I have worked with RESTful APIs for Trello, TSheets, AppFolio, QuickBooks Online, G Suite, RingCentral, and GPT. I have also worked with Monday.com's GraphQL API.
